## Plot
When memories fade away, and vows are erased, people may hardly recognised who they were. After 9 years apart, a business merge negotiation gather a couple, with different political and cultural backgrounds, back to Hong Kong at the same table again, together with their own phantoms of the old days which they now deny to admit.
