# Plot
"I don't know why I have so many bizarre behaviors and thoughts. I envy those grown-ups who look cool, who don't cry, who are owners of kittens and puppies, and who don't have to spend their days divining the whereabouts of their former lovers with tarot cards. My question is: how can I become a grown-up?"
