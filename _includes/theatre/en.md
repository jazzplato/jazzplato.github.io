While I was working on my master's degree in CMU, I secretly took an acting class in the Drama School. After graduation, I moved to Seattle area during the pandemic period. In 2023, I met [Christie](https://www.christiezhao.com/), [Kikyou](https://kikyouyan.com/), and a group of talented and professional artists, and they introduced me to [Yun Theatre](https://yun-theatre.com/) and a number of vibrant theatre companies and groups in the PNW area. Here is a list of productions I participated in Seattle.
