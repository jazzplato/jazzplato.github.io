Hi! I am _Richthofen_. It is a German name, known for the [Red Baron (_der Rote Baron_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_von_Richthofen) back in the WWI. The first time I knew about this name and the story of behind it was during my secondary school, and it has been my nick name on the cyberspace since then. I used to live in Chongqing, Singapore, Oslo, Pittsbugh; and I am now in the Seattle area.

As a profession, I am a Member of Technical Staff at [Microsoft AI Superintelligence Team (MSI)](https://microsoft.ai/superintelligence/) working on the boring compute infra side, scheduling, orchestration, and all sorts of things. My career path so far is mostly in the compute infra domain. Previously I was at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) working on compute infra on top of the Snowflake data cloud.  I used work at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) for [Snowpark Container Services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and [Sea](https://www.sea.com/home) for cross-region server cluster management platforms for on-prem data centers. I code in a few langagues, yet I see myself more of a Python guy. 

Apart from coding, I watch movies, [work in theatres](https://richthofen.io/theatre/?lang=en), and [roam around places](https://www.mytravelmap.xyz/u/gg113179410750853518940).
